# Rivière Extraction

Extract architecture from your codebase into a Rivière graph.

## How It Works

AI analyzes your code and calls CLI commands to build the graph. The CLI handles ID generation, validation, and error recovery. When AI makes mistakes, CLI suggests corrections.

## Get Started

- Components: APIs, UseCases, DomainOps, Events, EventHandlers
- Links: sync and async connections showing operational flow
