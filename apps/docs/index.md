features:
  - title: Flow-Based, Not Dependency-Based
    details: Trace how operations execute through your system—from UI to API to domain logic to events—not just what imports what.
  - title: AI-Assisted Extraction
    details: AI analyzes your code and calls CLI commands. The CLI validates and catches mistakes. Together they extract accurate architecture.
  - title: Interactive Visualization
    details: Explore your architecture in Éclair. Filter by domain, trace flows, compare versions, and understand your system at any level.
  - title: 100% Open Source
    details: Apache 2.0 licensed. Use it, fork it, contribute. Built in the open on GitHub.

## How It Works

<div class="workflow-diagram">
  <img src="/workflow-infographic.svg" alt="Workflow: Your Code → Extract → Rivière Schema → Visualize in Éclair">
</div>

<div class="products">

### Rivière Schema

A JSON format that captures how operations flow through your system — from UI to API to domain logic to events. Not just what imports what, but how things actually work.

**[Learn the Schema →](/reference/schema/graph-structure)**

### Rivière CLI

Point an AI assistant at your codebase. It calls CLI commands to analyze your code and build a Rivière schema.

**[CLI Guide →](/reference/cli/)**

### Rivière Builder

Build schemas programmatically in TypeScript. Integrate into build pipelines or create custom extraction tools.

**[Library Guide →](/get-started/quick-start)**

### Éclair

Load your schema into Éclair. Filter by domain, trace flows end-to-end, see which services publish and subscribe to events.

**[Explore the Demo →](https://living-architecture.dev/eclair/?demo=true)**

</div>

## Rivière Flow-Based Schema

Rivière extracts **flow-based architecture** directly from code. Instead of showing technical dependencies, it traces how operations flow through your system.

```text
UI /orders
  → API /bff/orders/place
  → UseCase: Place Order
  → DomainOp: Order.begin()
  → Event: order-placed
  → EventHandler: Prepare Shipping
```

## Run Locally

Clone the repo and run Éclair with the demo graph.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NTCoding/living-architecture.git
cd living-architecture
pnpm install
nx serve eclair
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/eclair/`
