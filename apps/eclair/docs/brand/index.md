## Éclair-Specific Guidelines

- [Themes](./themes.md) — Theme specifications, CSS variables, switching
- [Components](./components.md) — Buttons, cards, badges, form elements
- [Graph Visualization](./graph-visualization.md) — Canvas, nodes, edges, tooltips
- [Accessibility](./accessibility.md) — WCAG compliance, focus states, contrast

## Design Principles

1. **Theme consistency** — Same component behavior, different visual treatment
2. **Accessibility first** — WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
3. **Graph prominence** — Canvas is the hero element; UI should support, not compete
4. **Progressive disclosure** — Essential controls visible, advanced controls on demand

## Theme Summary

| Theme | Mode | Philosophy |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Stream** | Light | Modern, flowing, professional |
| **Voltage** | Dark | Cyberpunk, neon, high-energy |
| **Circuit** | Light | Minimal, technical, GitHub-inspired |
