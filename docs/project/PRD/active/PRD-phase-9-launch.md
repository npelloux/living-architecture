# PRD: Phase 9 — Launch

**Status:** Planning

**Depends on:** Phase 8 (Riviere CLI)

---

## 1. Problem

We need to make Living Architecture publicly available for early adopters:

- **npm packages** — riviere-query, riviere-builder, riviere-cli, riviere-schema published and installable
- **Hosted Éclair** — Visualizer accessible without local setup
- **Documentation** — Guides, API reference, examples available online
- **Landing page** — Entry point explaining what this is and why to use it

Currently nothing is published or deployed. Early adopters have no way to try the tools.

---

## 2. Design Principles

1. **Early adopter focus** — Functional and documented, not polished. Ship fast, iterate based on feedback.

2. **Single domain** — Everything under `living-architecture.dev`. Consistent brand, simpler setup.

3. **Automated releases** — CI/CD for both npm publishing and site deployment. No manual steps.

4. **Minimal landing page** — Clear value proposition, links to docs/Éclair. Not a marketing site.

5. **Pre-release versioning** — Start at 0.1.0. Breaking changes expected. Signal early-stage clearly.

6. **Conventional commits** — All commits follow conventional commit format for automated changelog generation.

---

## 3. What We're Building

### URL Structure

| Path | Content |
|------|---------|
| `living-architecture.dev` | Landing page |
| `living-architecture.dev/docs` | Documentation (VitePress) |
| `living-architecture.dev/eclair` | Visualizer app |

### npm Packages

| Package | Initial Version | Description |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| `@living-architecture/riviere-query` | 0.1.0 | Query graphs in browser/Node.js |
| `@living-architecture/riviere-builder` | 0.1.0 | Build graphs programmatically |
| `@living-architecture/riviere-cli` | 0.1.0 | CLI for AI-assisted extraction |
| `@living-architecture/riviere-schema` | 0.1.0 | Schema definitions and validation |

### Landing Page

Simple static page:
- What is Living Architecture? (1 paragraph)
- Key capabilities (3-4 bullet points)
- Links: Docs, Éclair, GitHub, npm
- Example visualization screenshot

### Demo Application

The **ecommerce-demo-app** (github.com/NTCoding/ecommerce-demo-app) serves as a complete example:
- Real TypeScript codebase with domain-driven architecture
- Uses published npm packages (`@living-architecture/riviere-cli`)
- Architecture extracted using AI-assisted workflow
- Includes custom types (message queues, external integrations)
- Pre-extracted graph viewable in Éclair
- Contains `.riviere/` folder with extracted graph

This proves the full workflow works and gives early adopters a realistic reference.

### Deployment Infrastructure

- **Cloudflare Pages** for hosting docs and Éclair (free tier: 500 builds/month, unlimited bandwidth)
- **GitHub Actions** for npm publishing on release tags
- **Automated deploys** on push to main via Cloudflare Pages

---

## 4. What We're NOT Building

- Marketing website with multiple pages
- User accounts or authentication
- Analytics dashboard
- Paid features or tiers
- Custom domain email
- Announcement/launch communications (blog, social media)

---

## 5. Success Criteria

**npm Publishing:**
- [ ] All 4 packages published to npm at 0.1.0
- [ ] `npm install @living-architecture/riviere-cli` works
- [ ] `npx riviere --help` runs successfully
- [ ] Package READMEs link to docs

**Hosting:**
- [ ] `living-architecture.dev` loads landing page
- [ ] `living-architecture.dev/docs` loads documentation
- [ ] `living-architecture.dev/eclair` loads visualizer
- [ ] HTTPS enabled on all paths
- [ ] Deploys automatically on push to main

**Content:**
- [ ] Landing page explains value proposition
- [ ] Docs cover getting started, API reference, examples
- [ ] At least one complete example graph included

**Demo:**
- [ ] Demo app uses published riviere-cli
- [ ] Demo loads and works in Éclair end-to-end

---

## 6. Resolved Questions

1. **Domain** — `living-architecture.dev` needs to be registered. Added to M3 deliverables.
2. **npm scope** — `@living-architecture` is owned and ready.
3. **Versioning** — Start at 0.1.0 (pre-release). Breaking changes expected.
4. **Changelog** — Auto-generate from conventional commits using release-please or similar.
5. **Commit enforcement** — commitlint + husky locally; CI validates PR titles follow conventional format.
6. **riviere-schema** — Will be published (move to packages/, remove private flag, cleanup trigger field).
