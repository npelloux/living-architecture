# PRD: Phase 10 — TypeScript Component Extraction

**Status:** Draft

**Depends on:** Phase 9 (Launch)

---

## 1. Problem

Architecture extraction currently relies on AI assistance—slow, non-deterministic, and impractical for CI integration.

We need deterministic TypeScript extraction that:
- Identifies architectural components (APIs, use cases, domain operations, events, handlers)
- Runs in seconds, not minutes
- Produces consistent results on every build
- Works as a library and CLI (can plug into existing workflows)

This phase focuses on components only. Metadata extraction comes in PRD 11, connection detection in PRD 12.

---

## 2. Design Principles

1. **Deterministic and fast** — Extraction runs in seconds. No AI, no network calls. Suitable for CI/every build.

2. **Language-agnostic DSL** — YAML/JSON config, validated by JSON Schema. Can support TypeScript, Java, C# extractors in the future.

3. **Simple detection rules** — `find` (classes/methods/functions) + `where` (predicates with explicit `and`/`or`).

4. **Enforcement as first-class concept** — Config without enforcement is unreliable. We provide simple enforcement for our conventions; document the principle for others.

5. **Module-based config** — Organize extraction rules by path/module at the top level. Single config, single extraction run.

6. **Schema validates everything** — Component types, find targets, predicate names, structure. Errors caught at config validation, not extraction runtime.

7. **Components only** — This phase extracts component nodes. Connections come later.

## 3. What We're Building

### Package Structure

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@living-architecture/riviere-extract-config` | Config format definition (JSON Schema). What makes a valid extraction config. |
| `@living-architecture/riviere-extract-conventions` | Our decorators + default config + ESLint enforcement. |
| `@living-architecture/riviere-extract-ts` | TypeScript extractor. Reads config, extracts components. |

### Dependencies

```text
riviere-extract-ts
└── uses riviere-extract-config

riviere-extract-conventions
└── uses riviere-extract-config

riviere-cli
└── uses riviere-extract-ts
```

### Config DSL

Module-based structure with explicit `and`/`or` logic:

```yaml
modules:
  orders:
    path: 'orders/**'
    API:
      find: methods
      where:
        and:
          - hasDecorator: API
          - inClassWith:
              hasDecorator: APIController
    UseCase:
      find: classes
      where: hasDecorator: UseCase
    Event:
      find: classes
      where: extendsClass: DomainEvent
    DomainOp: notUsed
    EventHandler: notUsed
    UI: notUsed

  shipping:
    path: 'shipping/**'
    API:
      find: methods
      where: hasJSDoc: '@riviere API'
    UseCase:
      find: functions
      where: hasJSDoc: '@riviere UseCase'
    # ... etc
```

### Detection Predicates

| Predicate | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `hasDecorator` | Class/method has specified decorator |
| `hasJSDoc` | Has specified JSDoc tag |
| `extendsClass` | Extends specified base class |
| `implementsInterface` | Implements specified interface |
| `nameEndsWith` | Name ends with pattern |
| `nameMatches` | Name matches regex |
| `inClassWith` | Method is in class matching condition |
| `and` | All conditions must match |
| `or` | Any condition must match |

### Decorator References

Can reference decorators from specific packages:

```yaml
hasDecorator:
  from: '@nestjs/common'
  name: Get, Post, Put, Delete
```

### CLI Integration

Added to existing riviere-cli:

```bash
riviere extract --config ./extraction.config.yaml
riviere extract --config ./extraction.config.yaml --dry-run
```

### Output Format

Draft components as JSON. Not a valid Riviere graph (no connections). Implementation detail of CLI/extraction. Format documented in package.

---

## 4. What We're NOT Building

- **Metadata extraction** — Extracting component properties (HTTP paths, state transitions). PRD 11.
- **Connection detection** — Flow linking, event→handler matching. PRD 12.
- **Graph merging** — Combining multiple graphs. PRD 13.
- **Other language extractors** — TypeScript only. Java, C#, Go are future work.
- **Real-time extraction** — On-demand CLI, not file watcher.
- **IDE plugins** — ESLint provides IDE feedback. No custom VS Code extension.
- **Auto-generated enforcement** — We provide simple enforcement for our conventions; others write their own.
- **Config inheritance/extends** — Document the concept, but don't implement in v1.

---

## 5. Success Criteria

1. `riviere-extract-config` package published with JSON Schema
2. `riviere-extract-conventions` package published with decorators + default config + ESLint rule
3. `riviere-extract-ts` package published
4. `riviere extract` command added to CLI
5. Extraction runs in <5 seconds on ecommerce-demo-app
6. With enforcement enabled, 100% component detection (no false negatives)
7. ecommerce-demo-app updated with multi-strategy extraction per domain
8. Architecture docs updated with new packages + extraction principles
9. ADR created for DSL design decisions
10. Public docs updated for deterministic extraction
11. Domain terminology glossary updated

---

## 6. Open Questions

1. **Output format / draft mode** — Extracted components aren't valid for the full Riviere schema. What's the exact intermediate format? JSON from CLI, documented structure, implementation detail. Need to define the specific fields.

## 9. Reference

### Inspiration

- **sequence-mapper** (`/Users/nicktune/code/employee-management/tools/sequence-mapper`) — DSL-based extraction with ts-morph, detection strategies, field extractors
- **Research on existing DSLs:** ESLint selectors, TSQuery, ASTQ, Semgrep, CodeQL

### Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Config format | YAML/JSON | Language-agnostic, easy to validate with JSON Schema |
| AST parser | ts-morph | TypeScript-native, full type information |
| Detection | Decorators + ESLint | Guarantees accuracy over heuristics |
| Output | Draft JSON | Components only, connections in later PRD |
