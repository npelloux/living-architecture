# PRD: Phase 5 — Riviere Query Package

**Status:** Approved

**Depends on:** Phase 4 (Monorepo Setup) — Complete

---

## 1. Problem

We need a production-quality query package (`@living-architecture/riviere-query`) that can:
- Query Rivière graphs for analysis and visualization
- Validate graphs against the Rivière schema with ultra-robust error reporting
- Work in both browser and Node.js environments
- Support Éclair migration from POC (requires diff capability)

The POC implementation exists but will be rewritten from scratch using the POC as a specification, not as code to copy.

---

## 2. Design Principles

1. **Ultra-robust validation** — Full JSON Schema validation using ajv. Catch errors early with clear messages.
2. **Complete API parity** — All POC methods, not a subset. No compromises on functionality.
3. **Browser-safe** — Zero Node.js dependencies. Must work in Éclair and other browser apps.
4. **Type-safe** — Full TypeScript with strict mode. No `any`.
5. **100% test coverage** — Production quality from day one.
6. **Diff support** — Required for Éclair migration from POC.
7. **Documentation from code** — TSDoc comments generate API reference via TypeDoc.

---

## 3. What We're Building

### Package: `@living-architecture/riviere-query`

### Complete API Surface

**Construction & Data Access:**
```typescript
constructor(source: QuerySource | RiviereGraph)
static fromFile(contents: string): RiviereQuery
components(): Component[]
links(): Link[]
```

**Search & Lookup:**
```typescript
find(predicate: (c: Component) => boolean): Component | undefined
findAll(predicate: (c: Component) => boolean): Component[]
componentById(id: string): Component | undefined
search(query: string): Component[]  // Case-insensitive, searches name/domain/type
```

**Domain & Component Filtering:**
```typescript
componentsInDomain(domainName: string): Component[]
componentsByType(type: ComponentType): Component[]
domains(): Domain[]
```

**Entity & State Management:**
```typescript
entities(domainName?: string): Entity[]
operationsFor(entity: string): DomainOp[]
statesFor(entity: string): string[]  // Ordered by transitions
transitionsFor(entity: string): EntityTransition[]
businessRulesFor(entity: string): string[]
```

**Event Handling:**
```typescript
publishedEvents(domainName?: string): PublishedEvent[]
eventHandlers(eventName?: string): EventHandlerInfo[]
```

**Graph Traversal & Flow Analysis:**
```typescript
traceFlow(startNodeId: string): FlowResult  // Bidirectional
flows(): Flow[]  // All flows from entry points
searchWithFlow(query: string): SearchWithFlowResult
entryPoints(): Component[]  // UI, API, EventHandler, Custom with no incoming links
```

**Domain Analysis:**
```typescript
crossDomainLinks(domainName: string): CrossDomainLink[]
domainConnections(domainName: string): DomainConnection[]
```

**Analytics:**
```typescript
stats(): GraphStats
nodeDepths(): Map<string, number>
detectOrphans(): string[]
```

**Diff & Comparison:**
```typescript
diff(other: RiviereGraph): GraphDiff
```

**Validation:**
```typescript
validate(): ValidationResult  // JSON Schema + structural checks
```

### Key Types

**Component** (discriminated union by `type`):
- `UI` — Frontend route (`route: string`)
- `API` — Endpoint (`apiType`, `httpMethod`, `httpRoute`, `operationName`)
- `UseCase` — Application service
- `DomainOp` — Domain operation (`operationName`, `entity?`, `stateChanges?`, `businessRules?`)
- `Event` — Published event (`eventName`, `eventSchema?`)
- `EventHandler` — Event subscriber (`subscribedEvents: string[]`)
- `Custom` — Extensible type

**Link:**
```typescript
interface Link {
  id?: string
  source: string
  target: string
  type?: 'sync' | 'async'
  sourceLocation?: SourceLocation
}
```

**Flow & Traversal:**
```typescript
interface FlowResult {
  nodeIds: string[]
  linkIds: string[]
}

interface Flow {
  entryPoint: Component
  steps: FlowStep[]
}

interface FlowStep {
  component: Component
  linkType: 'sync' | 'async' | undefined
  depth: number
}
```

**Analytics & Diff:**
```typescript
interface GraphStats {
  componentCount: number
  linkCount: number
  domainCount: number
  apiCount: number
  entityCount: number
  eventCount: number
}

interface GraphDiff {
  components: {
    added: Component[]
    removed: Component[]
    modified: ComponentModification[]
  }
  links: {
    added: Link[]
    removed: Link[]
  }
  stats: DiffStats
}
```

**Domain & Events:**
```typescript
interface Domain {
  name: string
  description: string
  systemType: 'domain' | 'bff' | 'ui' | 'other'
  componentCounts: Record<ComponentType, number> & { total: number }
}

interface PublishedEvent {
  id: string
  eventName: string
  domain: string
  handlers: EventSubscriber[]
}

interface EventHandlerInfo {
  id: string
  handlerName: string
  domain: string
  subscribedEvents: string[]
  subscribedEventsWithDomain: { eventName: string; sourceDomain?: string }[]
}
```

**Validation:**
```typescript
interface ValidationResult {
  valid: boolean
  errors: ValidationError[]
}

interface ValidationError {
  path: string
  message: string
  code: string
}
```

## 8. Open Questions

1. ~~**Validation library**~~ — Resolved: Use ajv
2. ~~**Bundle size**~~ — Resolved: Robustness over size. Accept larger bundle.
3. **Tree-shaking** — Ensure unused methods can be tree-shaken for smaller bundles in apps that don't use full API

---

## 9. Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- Phase 6 (Éclair migration) — Éclair needs Query package to replace POC imports
- Phase 7 (Builder) — Builder depends on Query
- Phase 8 (CLI) — CLI depends on Builder
